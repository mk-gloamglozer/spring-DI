# Spring-DI
## [unfinished]
Update of the OOP demo to use spring for dependancy injection

The program is designed to take inputs from the command line and Roll Dice. Via the interface it is possible to add and remove named dice and choose multiple dice to roll. The roller will give the sum of the dice rolled. 

If maven is installed it can be run with the command mvn exec::java

The UI is a bit shonky but it is only meant as a demo.
